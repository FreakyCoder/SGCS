	abstract = {To study how a social group, such as an ant colony, monitors events occurring throughout its territory, we present a model of a network of patrolling ants engaged in information collection and dissemination. In this network, individuals follow independent paths through a region and can exchange signals with each other upon encounter. The paths of the ants are described by correlated random walks. Through simulations and analytic approximations, including a new approach to the spatial logistic equation, we study the efficiency with which such a network discovers a constantly changing stream of "events" scattered throughout the region and the speed with which information spreads to all ants in the network. We demonstrate that efficiency of event discovery and the speed of information spread are enhanced by increased network size and straighter individual ant paths, and that these two effects interact. The results lead to predictions regarding the relations among species-specific movement patterns, colony size, and ant ecology.},

	abstract = {In swarm robotics multiple robots collectively solve problems by forming advantageous structures and behaviors similar to the ones observed in natural systems, such as swarms of bees, birds, or fish. However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate. In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems.},

When the world is moving into the nano technology, its mandatory to upgrade our robotic system into the nano or mini robotic systems. But the nano robots are limited with performing the complex task. To overcome this limitations, group of nano robots are operated in such a way to perform the complex operations. The main discussion in this paper is a small overview on the swarm robotics. Present situations researchers are facing multiple problems and some of them are found some solutions but mostly swarm robotics are having more problems which are needs to be addressed. The main predicament in swarm robotics is that swarm control and unavailability of coordinated algorithm for a particular application.

It is therefore to be distinguished from systems exhibiting chaotic behavior, for example, which are deterministic but unpredictable because of an exponential dependence on initial conditions. In emergent phenomena, higher-levels of organization are not determined by lower-levels of organization; or, more colloquially, emergent behavior is often said to be "greater than the sum of the parts". The concept plays an especially important but contentious role in the biological sciences. This essay is intended to demystify at least some aspects of the mystery of emergence.},

tirely virtual pheromones using a simulated environment with the Turtlebot
3 Burger and {ROS}. Implementation of the behavior is realized with multiple
processes responsible for localization, pheromone map creation, pheromone
sensing or navigation. As the pheromone is entirely virtual the sensing of the
pheromone uses a digital pheromone map which is exchanged using wireless
communications. The evaluation uses a best-case scenario in which the robots
drive between home and resource uninterrupted as baseline comparison. Three
different scenarios are tested which differ in environment, and number and
quality of resources. It is concluded that, while the performance is worse than
the baseline, the resource is reliably detected in the single resource scenario
but in the multi resource scenario the best resource is not found reliably.},

	abstract = {Stigmergy is a form of indirect communication and coordination in which agents modify the environment to pass information to their peers. In nature, animals use stigmergy by, for example, releasing pheromone that conveys information to other members of their species. A few systems in swarm robotics research have replicated this process by introducing the concept of artificial pheromone. In this paper, we present
              Phormica
              , a system to conduct experiments in swarm robotics that enables a swarm of e-puck robots to release and detect artificial pheromone.
              Phormica
              emulates pheromone-based stigmergy thanks to the ability of robots to project {UV} light on the ground, which has been previously covered with a photochromic material. As a proof of concept, we test
              Phormica
              on three collective missions in which robots act collectively guided by the artificial pheromone they release and detect. Experimental results indicate that a robot swarm can effectively self-organize and act collectively by using stigmergic coordination based on the artificial pheromone provided by
              Phormica
