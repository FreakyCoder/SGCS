	abstract = {To study how a social group, such as an ant colony, monitors events occurring throughout its territory, we present a model of a network of patrolling ants engaged in information collection and dissemination. In this network, individuals follow independent paths through a region and can exchange signals with each other upon encounter. The paths of the ants are described by correlated random walks. Through simulations and analytic approximations, including a new approach to the spatial logistic equation, we study the efficiency with which such a network discovers a constantly changing stream of "events" scattered throughout the region and the speed with which information spreads to all ants in the network. We demonstrate that efficiency of event discovery and the speed of information spread are enhanced by increased network size and straighter individual ant paths, and that these two effects interact. The results lead to predictions regarding the relations among species-specific movement patterns, colony size, and ant ecology.},

	abstract = {In social insect colonies, workers perform a variety of tasks, such as foraging, brood care and nest construction. As the needs of the colony change, and as resources become available, colonies adjust the numbers of workers engaged in each task. Task allocation is the process that results in specific workers being engaged in specific tasks, in numbers appropriate to the current situation.},

	abstract = {In swarm robotics multiple robots collectively solve problems by forming advantageous structures and behaviors similar to the ones observed in natural systems, such as swarms of bees, birds, or fish. However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate. In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems.},
