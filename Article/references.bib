	abstract = {Area coverage and collective exploration are key challenges for swarm robotics. Previous research in this field has drawn inspiration from ant colonies, with real, or more commonly virtual, pheromones deposited into a shared environment to coordinate behaviour through stigmergy. Repellent pheromones can facilitate rapid dispersal of robotic agents, yet this has been demonstrated only for relatively small swarm sizes (N {\textless} 30). Here, we report findings from swarms of real robots (Kilobots) an order of magnitude larger (N {\textgreater} 300) and from realistic simulation experiments up to N = 400. We identify limitations to stigmergy in a spatially constrained, high-density environment—a free but bounded two-dimensional workspace—using repellent binary pheromone. At larger N and higher densities, a simple stigmergic avoidance algorithm becomes first no better, then inferior to, the area coverage of non-interacting random walkers. Thus, the assumption of robustness and scalability for such approaches may need to be re-examined when they are working at a high density caused by ever-increasing swarm sizes. Instead, subcellular biology, and diffusive processes, may prove a better source of inspiration at large N in high agent density environments.},

	abstract = {Stigmergy is a form of indirect communication and coordination in which agents modify the environment to pass information to their peers. In nature, animals use stigmergy by, for example, releasing pheromone that conveys information to other members of their species. A few systems in swarm robotics research have replicated this process by introducing the concept of artificial pheromone. In this paper, we present
              Phormica
              , a system to conduct experiments in swarm robotics that enables a swarm of e-puck robots to release and detect artificial pheromone.
              Phormica
              emulates pheromone-based stigmergy thanks to the ability of robots to project {UV} light on the ground, which has been previously covered with a photochromic material. As a proof of concept, we test
              Phormica
              on three collective missions in which robots act collectively guided by the artificial pheromone they release and detect. Experimental results indicate that a robot swarm can effectively self-organize and act collectively by using stigmergic coordination based on the artificial pheromone provided by

pheromone uses a digital pheromone map which is exchanged using wireless
communications. The evaluation uses a best-case scenario in which the robots
drive between home and resource uninterrupted as baseline comparison. Three
different scenarios are tested which differ in environment, and number and
quality of resources. It is concluded that, while the performance is worse than
the baseline, the resource is reliably detected in the single resource scenario

	abstract = {In swarm robotics multiple robots collectively solve problems by forming advantageous structures and behaviors similar to the ones observed in natural systems, such as swarms of bees, birds, or fish. However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate. In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems.},

Through simulations and analytic approximations, including a new approach to the spatial logistic equation, we study the efficiency with which such a network discovers a constantly changing stream of "events" scattered throughout the region and the speed with which information spreads to all ants in the network. We demonstrate that efficiency of event discovery and the speed of information spread are enhanced by increased network size and straighter individual ant paths, and that these two effects interact. The results lead to predictions regarding the relations among species-specific movement patterns, colony size, and ant ecology.},

Our results show that the repellent pheromone effect lasts more than twice as long as the attractive pheromone effect (78 min versus 33 min). Although the effects of these two pheromones decay at approximately the same rate, the initial effect of the repellent pheromone on branch choice is almost twice that of the attractive pheromone (48 \% versus 25 \% above control).

Swarm robotics aims to produce robust, scalable, and flexible self-organizing behaviors through local interactions from a large number of simple robots. In this paper, a novel pheromone model of swarm foraging behavior is developed based on a neural network. The output of a single neuron corresponds to the density of a pheromone, which diffuses to neighboring neurons through their local connections. A neural network is updated based on the proposed evaporation model. Neural networks can often mimic the dynamics and features of pheromones. Therefore, in this work, we develop an optimization method to determine the key parameters of cooperative foraging based on mathematical modeling. The differential equation variables represent the number of foraging robots assigned different tasks. The solutions of the differential equations represent the dynamics of the foraging behavior. The key parameters that affect task allocation are determined to make optimal decision rules. Simulation experiments are conducted under different foraging scenarios.

Using the proposed system, we investigated the collective behaviour of a robot swarm in a bio-inspired aggregation scenario, where robots aggregated on a circular pheromone cue with different environmental factors, that is, diffusion and pheromone shift.

In case one robot breaks down, another robot can take steps to repair the failed robot or take over the failed robot’s task. Although fault tolerance and robustness to individual failures have often been central arguments in favor of swarm robotic systems, few studies have been dedicated to the subject. In this paper, we take inspiration from the synchronized ﬂashing behavior observed in some species of ﬁreﬂies. We derive a completely decentralized algorithm to detect non-operational robots in a swarm robotic system. Each robot ﬂashes by lighting up its on-board light-emitting diodes ({LEDs}), and neighboring robots are driven to ﬂash in synchrony. Since robots that are suffering catastrophic failures do not ﬂash periodically, they can be detected by operational robots. We explore the performance of the proposed algorithm both on a real-world swarm robotic system and in simulation. We show that failed robots are detected correctly and in a timely manner, and we show that a system composed of robots with simulated self-repair capabilities can survive relatively high failure rates.},

We present an analysis based on both reliability modelling and experimental trials of a case study swarm performing team work, in which failures are deliberately induced. Our case study has been carefully chosen to represent a swarm task in which the overall desired system behaviour is an emergent property of the interactions between robots, in order that we can assess the fault tolerance of a self-organising system. Our findings show that in the presence of worst-case partially failed robots the overall system reliability quickly falls with increasing swarm size. We conclude that future large scale swarm systems will need a new approach to achieving high levels of fault tolerance.},

	abstract = {The advent of the swarm makes it feasible to dynamically monitor a wide area for maritime applications. The crucial problems of underwater swarm monitoring are communication and behavior coordination. To tackle these problems, we propose a wide area monitoring strategy that searches for static targets of interest simultaneously. Traditionally, an underwater robot adopts either acoustic communication or optical communication. However, the former is low in bandwidth and the latter is short in communication range. Our strategy coordinates underwater robots through indirect communication, which is inspired by social insects that exchange information by pheromone. The indirect communication is established with the help of a set of underwater communication nodes. We adopt a virtual pheromone-based controller and provide a set of rules to integrate the area of interest into the pheromone. Based on the information in the virtual pheromone, behavior laws are developed to guide the swarm to monitor and search with nearby information. In addition, a robot can improve its performance when using additional far-away pheromone information. The monitoring strategy is further improved by adopting a swarm evolution scheme which automatically adjusts the visiting period. Experimental results show that our strategy is superior to the random strategy in most cases.},

While robot swarms are often designed to mimic some aspect of the behavior of social insects or other organisms, no systems have yet addressed all of these capabilities in a single framework. We describe a swarm robotics system that emulates ant behaviors, which govern memory, communication, and movement, as well as an evolutionary process that tailors those behaviors into foraging strategies that maximize performance under varied and complex conditions. The system evolves appropriate solutions to different environmental challenges. Solutions include the following: (1) increased communication when sensed information is reliable and resources to be collected are highly clustered, (2) less communication and more individual memory when cluster sizes are variable, and (3) greater dispersal with increasing swarm size. Analysis of the evolved behaviors reveals the importance of interactions among behaviors, and of the interdependencies between behaviors and environments. The effectiveness of interacting behaviors depends on the uncertainty of sensed information, the resource distribution, and the swarm size. Such interactions could not be manually specied, but are effectively evolved in simulation and transferred to physical robots. This work is the rst to demonstrate high-level robot swarm behaviors that can be automatically tuned to produce efcient collective foraging strategies in varied and complex environments.},

	abstract = {Representation and control of the dynamics of stigmergic substances used by bio-inspired approaches is a challenge when applied to robotics. In order to overcome this challenge, this work proposes a model to coordinate swarms of robots based on the virtualisation and control of these substances in a local scope. The model presents a new pheromone modelling, which enables the decentralisation and asynchronicity of navigation decisions. Each robot maintains an independent virtual pheromone map, which is continuously updated with the robot's deposits and pheromone evaporation. Moreover, the individual pheromone map is also updated by aggregating information from other robots that are exploring nearby areas. Thus, individual and independent maps replace the need of a centralising agent that controls and distributes the pheromone information, which is not always practicable. Pheromone information propagation is inspired by ants' vibroacoustic communication, which, in turn, is characterised as an indirect communication through a type of gossip protocol. The proposed model was evaluated through an agent simulation software, implemented by the authors, and in the Webots platform. Experiments were carried out to validate the model in different environments, with different shapes and sizes, as well as varying the number of robots. The analysis of the results has shown that the model was able to perform the coordination of the swarm, and the robots have exhibited an expressive performance executing the surveillance task.},

Our group recruitment and cooperative transport algorithms provide the robots with the required swarm behavior.

The results show that the robots can communicate using pheromone trails, and that the improvement due to pheromone communication may be non-linear, depending on the size of the robot swarm.},

	abstract = {An environment can be searched far more efficiently if the appropriate search strategy is used. Because of the limited individual abilities of swarm robots, namely, local sensing and low processing power, random searching is the main search strategy used in swarm robotics. The random walk methods that are used most commonly are Brownian motion and Lévy flight, both of which mimic the self-organized behavior of social insects. However, both methods are somewhat limited when applied to swarm robotics, where having the robots search repeatedly can result in highly inefficient searching. Therefore, by analyzing the characteristics of swarm robotic exploration, this paper proposes an improved random walk method in which each robot adjusts its step size adaptively to reduce the number of repeated searches by estimating the density of robots in the environment. Simulation experiments and experiments with actual robots are conducted to study the effectiveness of the proposed method and evaluate its performance in an exploration mission. The experimental results presented in this paper show that an area is covered more efficiently using the proposed method than it is using either Brownian motion or Lévy flight.},

The architecture is developed under the premise that {UAVs} are controlled as a distributed system. The distributed system-based technique maximizes the search and detection capabilities of multiple {UAVs}. We use a hybrid approach that combines a set of intentional cooperative rules with emerging properties of a swarm to accomplish the objective. The {UAVs} are equipped only with low-precision {RF} direction nding sensors and we assume the targets may emit signals randomly with variable duration. Once a target is detected, each {UAV} optimizes a cost function to determine whether to participate in a cooperative localization task. The cost function balances between the completion of detecting all targets (global search) in the search space and increasing the precision of cooperatively locating already detected targets. A search function for each {UAV} determines the collective search patterns of collaborating {UAVs}. Two functions used by each {UAV} determine (1) the optimal number of {UAVs} involved in locating targets, (2) the search pattern to detect all targets, and (3) the {UAV} ight path for an individual {UAV}. We show the validity of our algorithm using simulation results. Hardware implementation of the strategies is planned for this coming year.},

Due to its effectiveness; articial pheromones have been adopted in multi-robot and swarm robotic systems for more than a decade. Although, pheromonebased communication was implemented by different means like chemical (use of particular chemical compounds) or physical ({RFID} tags, light, sound) ways, none of them were able to replicate all the aspects of pheromones as seen in nature. In this paper, we propose a novel articial pheromone system that is reliable, accurate and it uses off-the-shelf components only – {LCD} screen and low-cost {USB} camera. The system allows to simulate several pheromones and their interactions and to change parameters of the pheromones (diffusion, evaporation, etc.) on the y allowing for controllable experiments. We tested the performance of the system using the Colias platform in single-robot and swarm scenarios. To allow the swarm robotics community to use the system for their research, we provide it as a freely available open-source package.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a control law for efcient area coverage and pop-up threat detection by a robot swarm inspired by the dynamical behavior of ant colonies foraging for food. In the rst part, performance metrics that evaluate area coverage in terms of characteristics such as rate, completeness and frequency of coverage are developed. Next, the Keller–Segel model for chemotaxis is adapted to develop a virtual-pheromone-based method of area coverage. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the model parameters such as rate of pheromone diffusion, rate of pheromone evaporation, and white noise intensity then identify and establish noise intensity as the most inuential parameter in the context of efcient area coverage and establish trends between these different parameters which can be generalized to other pheromone-based systems. In addition, the analyses yield optimal values for the model parameters with respect to the proposed performance metrics. A nite resolution of model parameter values were tested to determine the optimal one. In the second part of the work, the control framework is expanded to investigate the efcacy of non-Brownian search strategies characterized by Le´vy ight, a non-Brownian stochastic process which takes variable path lengths from a power-law distribution. It is shown that a control law that incorporates a combination of gradient following and Le´vy ight provides superior area coverage and pop-up threat detection by the swarm. The results highlight both the potential benets of robot swarm design inspired by social insect behavior as well as the interesting possibilities suggested by considerations of non-Brownian noise.},

Combining the endurance, range, and processing capabilities of the motherships with the stealth, flexibility, and maneuverability of swarms of daughterships enables robust control of aerial robot networks conducting collaborative operations. The hierarchical control structure decomposes the system into components that take advantage of the abilities of the different types of vehicles. The motherships act as distributed databases, fusion centers, negotiation agents, and task supervisors while daughtership control is achieved using cooperative vector field tracking. This paper describes the overall architecture and then focuses on the assignment and tracking algorithms used once sub- teams of daughtership vehicles have been deployed. A summary of the communication, command, and control structure of a heterogeneous unmanned aircraft system is also given in this paper along with hardware-in-the-loop and software simulation results verifying several components of the distributed control architecture.},

Using the concept of ‘repellent virtual pheromones’ inspired by insect colony coordination behaviors, miniature robots can be quickly dispersed to survey a disaster site. Assisted by visual servoing, dispersion of the miniature robots can quickly cover an area. An external observer such as another robot or an overhead camera is brought into the control loop to provide each miniature robot estimations of the positions of all of the other near-by robots in the robotic team. These miniature robots can then move away from the other near-by robots on the team, resulting in the robot collective becoming swiftly distributed through the local area. The technique has been simulated with differing pheromone persistence levels and implemented using the miniature Scout robots, developed by the Center for Distributed Robotics at the University of Minnesota, which are well-suited to surveillance and reconnaissance missions.},

This enables our robot collective to become a distributed computing mesh embedded within the environment, while simultaneously acting as a physical embodiment of the user interface.

We propose a novel system architecture based on a hive-drone model that simplifies the functionality of an individual {MAV} to a sequence of sensing and actuation commands with no in-field communication. This decision simplifies the hardware and software complexity of individual {MAVs} and moves the complexity of coordination entirely to a central hive computer.

Through simulation and testbed experiments we demonstrate how applications in Karma can run on limited resources, are robust to individual {MAV} failure, and adapt to changes in the environment.},

	abstract = {Flying insects capable of navigating in highly cluttered natural environments can withstand in-flight collisions because of the combination of their low inertia1 and the resilience of their wings2, exoskeletons1 and muscles. Current insect-scale (less than ten centimetres long and weighing less than five grams) aerial robots3–6 use rigid microscale actuators, which are typically fragile under external impact. Biomimetic artificial muscles7–10 that are capable of large deformation offer a promising alternative for actuation because they can endure the stresses caused by such impacts. However, existing soft actuators11–13 have not yet demonstrated sufficient power density to achieve lift-off, and their actuation nonlinearity and limited bandwidth create further challenges for achieving closed-loop (driven by an input control signal that is adjusted based on sensory feedback) flight control. Here we develop heavier-than-air aerial robots powered by soft artificial muscles that demonstrate open-loop (driven by a predetermined signal without feedback), passively stable (upright during flight) ascending flight as well as closed-loop, hovering flight. The robots are driven by multi-layered dielectric elastomer actuators that weigh 100 milligrams each and have a resonance frequency of 500 hertz and power density of 600 watts per kilogram. To increase the mechanical power output of the actuator and to demonstrate flight control, we present ways to overcome challenges unique to soft actuators, such as nonlinear transduction and dynamic buckling. These robots can sense and withstand collisions with surrounding obstacles and can recover from in-flight collisions by exploiting material robustness and vehicle passive stability. We also fly two micro-aerial vehicles simultaneously in a cluttered environment. They collide with the wall and each other without suffering damage. These robots rely on offboard amplifiers and an external motion-capture system to provide power to the dielectric elastomer actuators and to control their flight. Our work demonstrates how soft actuators can achieve sufficient power density and bandwidth to enable controlled flight, illustrating the potential of developing next-generation agile soft robots.},
