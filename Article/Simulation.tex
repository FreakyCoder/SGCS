\section{Simulation}
A 2D simulation is developed to assess the performance of SGCS and specifically its robustness. The following parameters can be set at the start: simulation steps($T$), area width($W$) and height($H$), sensor range($s_{sens}$), number of robots($n_r$), communication range($s_{comm}$), individual malfunction chance of each robot($P(F)$), speed($v$), and pheromone decay rate($r_{pdcy}$). 
The simulation performs the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For each robot, randomly decide whether to destroy it, based on $P(F)$. 
	\item Simulate the draining of the battery of each robot.
	\item Destroy every robot whose battery is fully drained.
	\item Execute the main algorithm for each robot.
	\item The distance between each pair of individuals $s_{ij}$ is calculated and compared with the communication range $s_{comm}$. If $s_{ij}<s_{comm}$, the pair synchronizes their virtual pheromone maps to simulate communication with limited range.
\end{enumerate}
